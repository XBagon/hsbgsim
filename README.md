## Hearthstone Battlegrounds Simulator
Focused on combat simulation.

This is still very Work in Progress, misses most effects of minions, events to support those and is probably very inaccurate even with minions that have their effects already implemented.

Basic stucture of the simulation is implemented, more minion effects and events should follow.
A better output format and tests are planned as important development support.
